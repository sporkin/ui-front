# Jitter

Simple continuous compilation for [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org), from the author
of *[CoffeeScript: Accelerated JavaScript Development](http://pragprog.com/titles/tbcoffee/coffeescript)*.

Jitter watches for new files and changes to files in the CoffeeScript source directory
you specify, and compiles new JavaScript files as needed. No flags, no worries, just the
sweet CoffeeScript compilation you need when you need it.

***Bonus!*** Jitter gives you Growl notifications when compilation fails! See below for
details.

***Extra bonus!*** Jitter lets you automatically compile and run a second set of code after
each successful compilation. That means that console-based tests are a breeze.

***Extra, extra bonus!*** Jitter only replaces JS files when necessary (that is, when your
CoffeeScript and JavaScript are out of sync). So no more meaningless timestamp changes!

## Compatibility

Jitter uses Node's `fs.watchFile` API, which means that it's compatible with
Node <= 0.6.x (but incompatible with Windowsâ€”sorry).

## Installing

You'll need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/), the
Node Package Manager. If you don't already have CoffeeScript installed (check with
`require('coffee-script')` from Node), run

    npm install -g coffee-script

(The `-g` flag tells npm that you want to do a *global* install, rather than just making
the library available to a particular project.) And adding Jitter is just as easy:

    npm install -g jitter

Make sure that the `bin` directory that `coffee` and `jitter` are installed to is on
your PATH.

### From source

To build and install Jitter from source:

    git clone git://github.com/TrevorBurnham/Jitter.git
    cd Jitter
    npm install -g

## To use:

Let's say you have a bunch of `*.coffee` files in the `coffee` directory, and want to
compile them to the `js` directory. Then run:

    jitter coffee js

Jitter runs in the background until you terminate it (Ctrl+C), watching for new changes.

Or let's say you want to take `*.coffee` files from the `src` directory and compile them
to the current directory. Then run

    jitter src .

To automatically run your tests after each change, specify a test directory:

    jitter coffee js test

Tests will be compiled to js in place, then executed with node. Tests are automatically
re-executed when changed.

## Growl notifications

Jitter will display a growl notification whenever compilation fails, provided that you
have [growlnotify](http://growl.info/extras.php) installed and on your PATH. This allows
you to run Jitter silently in the background, not worrying about it until you get a
syntax error.

Growl notifications are also shown if an error is encountered while running a test,
including uncaught `AssertionError`s.
